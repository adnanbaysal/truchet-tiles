# How to run
First install dependencies, preferably in a virtual environment. 

Then, run the web server with `python web_ui/manage.py` (or using the `Django` debug config if you are using VS Code).
Some settings will not take affect depending on other settings:

* Hybrid fill mode needs Curved to be selected.
* Animation mode and Animation duration need Animate to be selected.
* Grid line width and color needs grid to be enabled
